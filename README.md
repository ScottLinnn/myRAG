# myRAG

Self-studying RAG.

## Roadmap

[Advanced RAG Techniques: an Illustrated Overview](https://pub.towardsai.net/advanced-rag-techniques-an-illustrated-overview-04d193d8fec6) is a great article that explained _many_ techniques in a RAG pipeline. My next step is building my own pipeline, trying various techniques introduced in the article and using benchmarks to see how they perform.
